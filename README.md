# pixelmonStarterRandomizer

This project was created for Minecraft 1.12 Pixelmon mod. With the mod's hocon file it is possible to customize the available starter Pokémon ("starters"), so instead of having to choose between the default starters from the original Pokémon games, you can pick one of those written in the "starter" section of the hocon file. This affects the mod's welcome screen when starting a new Minecraft world/save file (or by typing the "/pokerestart" command).

This project is meant to bring a little diversity and fun to the game, because you do not have to select and put the Pokémon in the hocon file yourself.
