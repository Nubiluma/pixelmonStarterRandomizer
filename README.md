# pixelmonStarterRandomizer

This project was created for Minecraft 1.12 Pixelmon mod.
With the mod's hocon file it is possible to customize the available starter Pokémon which you have to pick when joining a new Minecraft world. Instead of having to choose between the default starters from the original Pokémon games (currently 21), you can pick one of the Pokémon written in the "starter" section of the hocon file.

This project is meant to bring a little diversity and fun to the game by completely randomzing the available starter Pokémon. For safety reasons, the original hocon file will not be replaced automatically in the configs directory. Instead, the customized hocon file will be created in the project's directory.
